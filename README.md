# glm_moment_closure
Demonstration of moment closure applied to autoregressive generaliezd linear point-process models

This repository demonstrates the application of moment closure to 
autoregressive point-process generalized linear models (PPGLMs).

Please see the iPython notebook `ARPPGLM_moment_equations` for further 
details.
