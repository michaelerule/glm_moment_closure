# GLM moment closure
This repository contains a demonstration of moment closure applied to autoregressive point-process generalized linear models (PPGLMs), to accompany the paper ["Autoregressive Point Processes as Latent State-Space Models: A Moment-Closure Approach to Fluctuations and Autocorrelations "](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/neco_a_01121). Please see the iPython notebook `ARPPGLM_moment_equations` for further details.

*Caption: Moment closure captures slow timescales in the mean and fast timescales in the variance. Five approaches for approximating the mean (black trace) and variance (shaded, 1Ïƒ ) of the log-intensity of the autoregressive PPGLM phasic bursting model, shown here in response to a 150 ms, 0.3 pA current pulse stimulus (vertical black lines). The Langevin equation retains essential slow-timescale features of point process, but moments must be estimated via computationally intensive Monte-Carlo sampling. The mean-field limit with linear noise approximation cannot capture the effects of fluctuations on the mean. Gaussian moment closure captures the influence of second-order statistics on the evolution of the mean, but underestimates the variance owing to incorrectly modeled skewness. A second-order approximation better captures the second moment. An (experimental) moment-closure based on the gamma distribution provides the most accurate recovery of the mean.*

*Caption: Moment closure methods provide a way to convert between autoregressive and state-space point-process models. The history of the point process is taken as the state space, and moment-closure provides (nonlinear) equations governing the time evolution of the latent distribution over this state-space, approximated as a Gaussian process (red).*
